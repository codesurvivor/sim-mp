This is not a ``real" README. It is too preliminary;) Please feel free to 
contact me. I will provide ``ALL" the information you need:)

Compile popnet, please use gcc 3.4.2 in linux. Just type ``make popnet". 
To run popnet, we put a short network trace in ./random_trace, which models
random network traffic in a 9x9 2D network. To run popnet, you can type the
following command:

./popnet -A 9 -c 2 -V 3 -B 12 -O 12 -F 4 -L 1000 -T 20000 -r 1 -I ./random_trace/bench -R 0

-A 9: the size of the network in each dimension. In this example, there are
nine routers on each dimension.
-c 2: 2D network
-B 12: input buffer size
-O 12: output buffer size
-F 4: flit size. We assume 64-bit flit unit, the actual flit size is then
      64 x 4 = 128
-L 1000: link length in um
-T 20000: simulation cycles
-r 1: random seed
-I ./random-trace/bench: trace file
-R 0: choose dimension routing

The current trace file has some ``weird" structure (to improve the simulation
efficiency). In random_trace directory, you can see in total 82 files. Among 
these trace files, the main trace file is ``bench", which contains all the 
network packets. In addition, each router <x,y> has its own trace file, named 
``bench.x.y", which contains all the locally injected packets. 

In each trace file, the basic format is:

T sx sy dx dy n

T: packet injection time
sx sy: the address of the source router
dx dy: the address of the destination router
n: packet size (number of flits)
