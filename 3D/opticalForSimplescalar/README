################## Make it work ###################
1. make clean:
	clean up all the *.o files.

2. make: 
	compile all the *.c files.

################## Clock Cycle ####################
1. Our Processor runs at 2.5GHz. Laser can run at 10GHz. So we have:
	4 Laser cycle = 1 CPU cycle
2. Transmitter size is 16 bits. which means 16 bits can be transmitted in one laser cycle.

3. Network cycle is the time spending on one flit transfer. 
	Network cycle = Flit_transfer_time = Flit_size/(laser_cycle * transmitter_size)


################## Packet size ####################
1. META (Type 1 = INV)
	= Address (40 bits) + message_type ID (5 bits) + thread identy ID (8 bits) + meta ID (5 bits) + packet_type (2 bits)
	= 60 bits

2. META (Type 2 = ACK)
	= message_type ID (5 bits) + thread identy ID (8 bits) + meta ID (5 bits) + packet_type (2 bits)
	= 20 bits

3. DATA (Type 1)
	= DATA_size (32 bytes = 256 bits) + meta_type2 (20 bits)
	= 276 bits

4. DATA (Type 2 = Write back)
	= DATA_size (256 bits) + meta_type1 (60 bits)
	= 296 bits


################ Configuration #####################
Depend on above discussion, we have the following network configuration

1. Flit Size = 64 bits

2. Network cycle = 64/64 = 1 = CPU cycle 

3. META Packet size = 1 flit = 64 bits

4. DATA Packet size = 5 flits 

5. META packet transmit time = 1 cycle

6. DATA packet transmit time = 5 cycle

7. LASER warm up time = 20 cycles

8. Laser set up time = 2 cycles

9. Laser switch off time_out = 5 cycles

10*. DATA transfer time slot
